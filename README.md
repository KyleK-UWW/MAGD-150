_Lab Assignment 6_: This was meant to have a retro game feel to the art in this lab, which features a bouncing yellow square with a large purple triangle bisceted by two cyan lines running from corner to corner. when you hover your mouse over the image a green ball will track your mouse position and multiply/fade as the mouse moves.

_Lab Assignment 7_: This Lab excersise was to enter values into arrays via a loop and have them printed in text, and appears very visually simple when loaded.

_Lab Assignment 8_: This Lab was to create a Greeting card, I chose a Holiday theme. The assignment focused on loading images from the asset file into the project. Visually this is my favorite so far and was the most fun to create. there are two snowmen one static as part of the background image and one which tracks and scales with the mouse position over the image.

_Design Document_: This document explains the piano project.
